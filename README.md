Here i forked the dairy managemnet system as part of learning practice in the PLP software engineering program.
                COMMANDS USED IN THE PROCESS
                1. git clone - used this for clonning and forking the project repository to my local machine so as to view the project structure.
                2. git branch - used this command to create a new branch "feature-updates".
                3. git checkout - to switch from the main branch to the "feature-updates" branch.
                4. git merge - to merge the two branches.
                5. git status - to check the errors that coused a conflict.

In the process I got to know about contributing to an open source project. I got to exprore this open source project. https://github.com/larymak/Python-project-Scripts/tree/main/MachineLearning%20Projects/Stock-Analysis.
